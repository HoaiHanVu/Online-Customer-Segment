# Online Customer Segmentation with RFM and K-Means Clustering, Deployed with Streamlit

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a robust customer clustering model for online businesses. We combine manual segmentation methods with unsupervised learning algorithms to achieve effective customer segmentation. By utilizing the RFM (Recency - Frequency - Monetary) framework for data preprocessing and applying KMeans clustering, we can identify distinct customer segments. This project has enabled us to gain valuable insights into business and marketing, demonstrating how the fusion of machine learning and business expertise can yield a powerful customer clustering model. The resulting segmentation assists businesses in formulating strategic plans for customer care and enhancing overall performance.

Features

- RFM Method: The repository implements the RFM framework for data preprocessing, which evaluates customer behavior based on recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- KMeans Clustering: We employ KMeans clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to segment customers based on RFM scores, identifying distinct customer groups.
- Streamlit Deployment: To provide a user-friendly experience, we have deployed the customer segmentation project using Streamlit. This allows users to interact with the application, input data, and visualize the resulting customer segments.
